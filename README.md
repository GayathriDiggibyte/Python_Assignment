Python Assignment
Assignment1 - Finding the Percentage
Get the list of marks for the given student_name from the dictionary
Initialize a variable to store the sum of marks
Iterate through each mark in the list
Add each mark to the sum
Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the total number of marks (in this case, 3)
Format the average to display only two decimal places and return it

Assignment2 - find runner up
remove the duplicate elements from the list
after that, find the second maximum score.

Assignment3 - mutate string
Convert the string 's' into a list of characters
Replace the character at position 'pos' with 'var_to_add'
Join the list back into a string
Return the mutated string

Assignment4 - divide the string
It starts by splitting the input string into substrings of length k.
For each substring, it removes duplicate characters and concatenates the unique characters.
It stores the resulting unique substrings in a list.
Finally, it joins the unique substrings with newline characters and returns the result.

Assignment5 - string format
print the decimal, octal, hexa decimal and binary

Assignment6 - print_pattern
input the thickness and print according to the thickness

Assignment7 - calendar module
input a date and print the day name of the particular date.

Assignment8 - avg()
input the data as table format with columns - id, student_name, marks, class and find the average of the marks of all the students.

Assignment9 - find the difference between time zones in seconds.

Assignment10 - find the floor, ceil and rint

Assignment11 - min_max() function takes input for the dimensions of a matrix and its elements, computes the minimum element in each row, and then returns the maximum of those minimums.

Assignment12 - determinant() function takes input for the size of a square matrix and its elements, computes the determinant of the matrix using NumPy's np.linalg.det() function, and returns the result rounded to two decimal places

Assignment13 - mean_var_std() function takes input for the dimensions of a matrix and its elements. It then calculates the mean along each row, variance along each column, and standard deviation of the flattened array. The results are returned as a string.

Assignment14 - find_happiness() function takes input for the number of elements in an array, the array itself, and two sets of integers A and B. It calculates the happiness score based on the elements in the array that belong to set A or set B.

Assignment15 - order_words() function takes input for the number of words, followed by the words themselves. It counts the occurrences of each word and returns the count of unique words followed by the count of occurrences of each unique word.

Assignment16 - piling_up() function simulates a game of piling up blocks. It takes input for the number of test cases, then for each test case, it takes input for the number of blocks followed by the heights of each block. It checks if it's possible to create a stack of blocks such that each block is smaller than the one below it. It returns "Yes" if it's possible, and "No" otherwise.

Assignment17 - find_probability() function calculates the probability of selecting a combination of indices from a list where each index corresponds to a character, and the probability is based on the presence of a specific character ('a' in this case) in the selected indices. It utilizes itertools.combinations to generate combinations of indices and calculates the probability based on the occurrence of 'a' in those combinations.

Assignment18 - filter_mail() function filters a list of email addresses based on a given pattern. It checks each email address against a regular expression pattern to determine if it matches the required format. If an email matches the pattern, it's added to the list of filtered emails, which is then sorted and returned.
